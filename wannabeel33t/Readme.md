Challenge : We are chasing down a hacker, wannabeel33t and we watch to catch him red-handed. He keeps a low profile online, but he has to have some bad habits... 

As it was marked easy i didn't use any OSINT tools i just googled the username wannabeel33t and find the reddit but it didn't have any comments or any activity but it has a text in
the user's bio

text: %66%6c%61%67%7b%36%36%62%31%35%33%34%37%63%35%38%63%39%31%64%31%39%33%37%66%30%62%34%30%65%39%37%33%64%33%66%36%7d

I opened cyberchef and URL decode it and that gave us the flag

flag: flag{66b15347c58c91d1937f0b40e973d3f6}
